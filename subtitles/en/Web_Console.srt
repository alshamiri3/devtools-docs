Web Console is usually first place you
go

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:10,91
when you're debugging a website or web app. It logs
information associated with the page,

3
00:00:10,91 --> 00:00:14,85
including JavaScript, CSS, and security
errors and warnings.

4
00:00:14,85 --> 00:00:18,83
Network requests and messages logged
using the console API.

5
00:00:18,83 --> 00:00:22,16
Errors, warnings and log messages

6
00:00:22,16 --> 00:00:26,19
get link next to them. Click the link
and you see the line of code that generated

7
00:00:26,19 --> 00:00:27,28
the message.

8
00:00:27,28 --> 00:00:30,6
JavaScript opened in the debugger

9
00:00:30,6 --> 00:00:37,34
and CSS puts you in the style editor.

10
00:00:37,34 --> 00:00:43,13
You can filter the messages using the
buttons along the top. If a network request

11
00:00:43,13 --> 00:00:43,73
fails,

12
00:00:43,73 --> 00:00:47,329
that's clearly marked, you can click on
network request to see more information

13
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:47,899
about it.

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,829
At the command line

15
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,71
you can execute JavaScript in the page context.
It has also a complete for

16
00:00:57,71 --> 00:01:02,14
objects to find in the page. If you click an
object

17
00:01:02,14 --> 00:01:07,799
you'll see more information about in
this pane on the right. You can interact

18
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,69
with this object on the page, too.

19
00:01:09,69 --> 00:01:14,96
And you can access the object using CSS
selectors.

20
00:01:14,96 --> 00:01:19,34
Of course you can modify variables

21
00:01:19,34 --> 00:01:23,17
The site is supposed to compare those two text
areas, when I click the button.

22
00:01:23,17 --> 00:01:30,17
But it doesn't work and logs an error. Looking at
the area, I might guess that this line

23
00:01:30,77 --> 00:01:37,77
contains a typo and I can test that theory out.

24
00:01:44,59 --> 00:01:47,76
This is just a really quick introduction to
the main features of the web console
